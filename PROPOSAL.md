Capstone Project – Baseball Hub for Casual Fans



Overview

The Baseball Hub will be a simple, easy-to-use website that helps casual baseball fans stay up to date on the current MLB season. Most sports websites are cluttered with ads and too much information — this site will focus on showing only the basics: team standings, player stats, and schedules.

Focus of the Project

This website will focus mainly on the frontend, with some basic backend work making API calls. The main goal is to fetch and display live baseball data clearly.

Goal

To create a simple, ad-free hub for baseball fans that lets users:

•	Check team standings and records

•	View player stats and basic info

•	See daily game schedules and scores

•	Look up stadium names and locations

If time allows, a “compare players” feature or league leaders section may be added as well as video highlights.  Longer range – maybe have usernames and passwords and the user can select favorite players and teams?

Data and API

The website will pull data from the MLB Stats API, which includes:

•	Player names, stats, and positions

•	Team records and standings

•	Game schedules and scores

•	Stadium names and locations

All data will come from public sources — no sensitive user data will be collected or stored unless usernames and passwords are eventually added.
